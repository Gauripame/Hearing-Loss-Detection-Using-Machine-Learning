(Major Project in master)
[Python | Django | MySQL | Bootstrap | HTML/CSS]
Developed a Hearing Loss Detection System using Gradient
Boosting Algorithm to analyze input factors such as age, dB
level, sex, and physical score. The system predicts hearing
impairment risks with high accuracy and provides early
detection insights.
Prepared a comprehensive project report, including system
architecture, methodology, model evaluation metrics
(accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and modular
documentation, ensuring clear understanding and structured
presentation of the project.
